Tomato Leaf Prediction Project
Overview
This GitHub repository contains a mini project focused on predicting tomato leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of tomato leaves into different disease categories.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the 'dataset' directory. It consists of labeled images of tomato leaves, each categorized into classes representing different diseases or healthy leaves.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tomato-leaf-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd tomato-leaf-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the model.

Model Training
The 'train_model.ipynb' Jupyter notebook contains the code for training the deep learning model. You can customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process according to your requirements.

Inference
The 'predict.py' script allows you to make predictions on new images using the trained model. Simply provide the path to the image you want to predict, and the script will output the predicted class.

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
Results
Details about the model's performance, including accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics, can be found in the 'results' directory.
